# annotations in Kubernetes are key-value pairs that can be attached to objects such as pods, services, and deployments. They are used to store arbitrary metadata that can be used by tools and libraries to enhance the functionality of Kubernetes resources.
# It is important to note that annotations are not used for identifying or selecting resources like labels. Instead, they provide additional context or information about the resource.
# annotations can be used for various purposes, such as storing build information, deployment details, or any other metadata that may be useful for managing and operating Kubernetes resources.
# annotations can be added to any Kubernetes object and can be accessed by tools and libraries that interact with the Kubernetes API.
# annotations are typically used for storing non-identifying information that is not intended to be used for selection or filtering of resources.
# annotations can be very useful for enhancing the functionality of Kubernetes resources and providing additional context for tools and libraries that interact with them.
# annotations can be added to Kubernetes resources using the metadata.annotations field in the resource definition.
# It is act as external selector for kubernetes resources.
